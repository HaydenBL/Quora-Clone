# Quora-Clone
A website with similar features to Quora made as a term-long project for my web and databases class in early in 2016. It's fairly messy, and has a lot of questionable design decisions, but it was a project made to learn most of this stuff. I don't plan on ever updating this, it's mainly here for archiving purposes. I am in no ways associated with Quora.
